### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm a physical sciences, technology, and classical music enthusiast who enjoys connecting with people from all around the world. I'm a current student at the University of Toronto studying Mathematics, Physics, and Computer Science.

Having grown up in 4 different countries/regions and with a diverse background, I have a significant amount of experience in international environments and am fluent in both Cantonese and Mandarin Chinese in addition to English. In my free time, I enjoy playing music, learning languages, as well as spending time with my friends and family.
